# Render Mermaid diagram in Webpage


For this you have to use two script tags, they are :

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js"></script>
```


```
<script>mermaid.initialize({theme: 'dark', startOnLoad:true});</script>
```

**For light theme you can replace that theme to light**

Then you can write the mermaid diagram code inside div with class mermaid

Example: 

```
<html>
  <body>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js"></script>
    <script>mermaid.initialize({ theme: 'dark', startOnLoad:true});</script>

    Here is one mermaid diagram:
    <div class="mermaid">
     pie title Some Title
         "FRIENDS" : 5
         "FAMILY" : 2
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

This will produce this output:
<div class="mermaid">
      pie title Some Title
         "FRIENDS" : 5
         "FAMILY" : 2
</div>
